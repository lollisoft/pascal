This is a migration from my old CVS PASCAL repository.

Be warned, this is very old code from DOS times. Using Turbo Pascal 6.0 and Turbo Vision 1.0 used in that version.

Build the code with an unix style make command. The relevant and wotking applications get built into C:\TP\Builds and the project
should be placed on C:\Q\Develop\Projects\Pascal and the C:\Q should be subst Q: C:\Q.

Build it from Q:\Develop\Projects\Pascal.

TVDV is a disk inventory system for diskettes only. A hard drive actually crashes with a stack overflow.

I am unsure, if I port the application idea to a modern version.

TVVT is a vocabulary system. I could provide some samples.

Both are build out of TVVT directory. TVDV was a try to refactor something to a more oop like code and was not made complete.

Have fun with my terrible beginner's coding experiences :-)
